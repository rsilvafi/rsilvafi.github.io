<h2 align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</span></h2>After
performing individual benchmarks with different infrastructures and
applications, we compared the results obtained in these experiments in
a horizontal way.<br><br>It
is important to note that infrastructures as Siena, CORBA-NS and Java
Spaces are reused "from the outside". I.e. they are extended as black
boxes, by building the required functionality around their provided
APIs. YANCEES, on the other hand, is configurable and extensible as a
grey box, allowing the modification of the set of features its supports
"from the inside". This fundamental difference is reflected in the
graphics below where both client and server side development efforts
are shown, together with combined effort (client + sever) in a separate
bar.<br><br><h2>Performance: usefulness and efficiency</h2>The
performance tests demonstrate: (1) The usefulness of YANCEES and the
other infrastructures in supporting different applicaiton domains; and
(2) the efficiency of these infrastructures when reused in different
contexts. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">EDEM performance results:</span><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 596px; height: 285px;" alt="EDEM performance" src="edem-performance-chart.PNG"><br></div><br>In
EDEM benchmarks, both JavaSpaces and CORBA-NS were not able to handle
the large amount/frequency of events demanded by the benchmark.
Moreover, these infrastructures must be executed in different processes.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CASSIUS performance results:</span><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 598px; height: 284px;" alt="CASSIUS performance" src="cassius-performance-chart.PNG"><br></div><br>In
the CASSIUS scenario, the native pull model of JavaSpaces gives it a
performance advantage. Whereas all the other infrastructures, including
CORBA-NS, need to implement a push-based event queue that store
notifications for later retrieval. This strategy results in higher
processing times for the other infrastructures.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPROMPTU performance results:</span><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 592px; height: 273px;" alt="IMPROMPTU performance" src="impromptu-performance-chart.PNG"><br></div><br>In
the IMPROMPTU scenarion, the JavaSpaces pull notificaiton model does
not perform well in this intrinsic push, fast forwarding application
domain.<br><h2>Reusability: Total Development Effort</h2><br>If
one
was required to build three different infrastructures to support the
trhee different scenarios we studied, the total cost of development in
terms of lines of code and complexity, for each infrastructure would be
as shown in the graphic below. Note that these numbers do not include
the initial development effort of each infrastructure, only the effort
of the user to adapt the infratructure to their needs. YANCEES is the
only infrastructure that includes development costs for the server side.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 576px; height: 289px;" alt="total cognitive effort" src="totalization-dev-effort-loc-cc.PNG"><br></div><br>The original LOC and McCAbe CC metrics used in our metrics are shown below.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 577px; height: 289px;" alt="development effort LOC" src="totalization-dev-effort-loc.PNG"><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 568px; height: 289px;" alt="Development effort CC" src="totalization-dev-effort-cc.PNG"><br></div><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><h3><br></h3><h2><a name="Findings"></a>Summary of Findings</h2><h3>Performance</h3>- The
performance of compositional (YANCEES) and minimal-core (Siena)
infrastructures&nbsp;are comparable to the best case build-from-scratch approach implementations.<h3>- Generalization versus specificity</h3>-
Generalization (in either subscription and notificatoin models), while support a larger set of application domains, require
extra programming effort to translate and parse specific concerns into generalized data and subscription formats.<br><h3>- Reuse: buy versus build</h3>-
The ability to customize the API to match application requirements
(YANCEES case) has two benefits: <br><ol><li>it divides the development effort between infrastructure producers and
consumers. </li><li>it reduces
client-side development effort since the infrastructure can be
customized to support the exact set of features required by the domain.</li></ol>-
However, these benefits come with high initial software development
costs. In order to pay-off that initial investment, YANCEES (as well as
the other approaches) need to be reused in
different contexts.<br><h3>- The costs of inflexibility</h3>- The
inflexibility of CORBA-NS, Siena and JavaSpaces requires API mismatches
to be handled in the client-side, by the application developers. This
not only increases the development effort, but also impacts the
performance of the application.<br><br>Examples of mismatches found during the benchmark: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - JavaSpaces inability to handle aritmetic filter operators as: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - JavaSpaces lack of support for pull notifications<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - JavaSpaces requires clients to find the tuple when a notification trigger is fired.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - CORBA-NS pull notifications does not match CASSIUS pull model<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Siena does not support pull notifications<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Siena Pattern implementation is different from the one required by EDEM.<br><br>-
Variation-based approaches as CORBA-NS provide a large set of options
in its API. The selection between these options needs to be performed
manually. The consequence is an increase in the infrastructure consumers' development effort.<br>-
The JavaSpaces model does not completely match the publish/subscribe
model, requiring extra effort to retrieve the events (represented as
tuples), from the space. This results in performance penalties and
extra development effort.<br><h2><a name="DesignImplications"></a>Implications for Infrastructures Design</h2>Coming soon.<br><h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
