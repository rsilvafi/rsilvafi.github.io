<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">
<span lang="en-us">In this project, we
study the use of configurable and extensible software architectures to
provide
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=versatility">versatility</a>
to event notification services (a.k.a. publish/subscribe
infrastructures). Its goal is to study the trade-offs involved in the
construction and use of such infrastructures.&nbsp;
Current industrial infrastrucutres strive to support the variability of
different application domains through the applicaiton of different
strategies: 1) Build new publish/subscribe infrastructures from
scratch; 2) Use minimal core infrastructures such as Siena, Elvin or
Scribe; 3) Use one-size-fits-all infrastructures as CORBA-NS or READY.
More recently, a new class of publish/subscribe infrastructures that
relies on compositional approaches have been created. Examples include
FACET, GREEN and YANCEES.&nbsp; YANCEES is an extensible and
configurable component framework that allows the construction of
application-specific publish/subscribe infrastructures. Examples of
such extensions
include subscriptions with event correlation, different notification
policies (push and pull), protocols for mobile
applications integration, ad-hoc P2P network protocols; event
persistence
services,
security and others. YANCEES configurability and extensibility is
achieved by the use of extensible languages and plug-in oriented
architectures, along main publish/subscribe design dimensions (event,
publication, subscription,
notification, protocol and resource models). In other
words, versatility
is achieved by:</span></p>


<blockquote>
  
  <p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"> <span lang="en-us">1. An
open, extensible and configurable architecture
where plug-ins can be installed<br>


2. Extensible event, notification, subscription and protocol languages<br>


  </span></p>


</blockquote>


The key insight on YANCEES is the separation of languages
(subscription,
notification and protocol) and their implementation (plug-ins), for
each design dimension of a notification server. Those two aspects are
then dynamically combined through the user of parsers and configuration
managers, allowing dynamic allocation of resources and the runtime
installation of new featuers to the infrastructure.&nbsp;Another
insight is that, different languages and adapters can be used,
simultaneously, allowing
the integration of different publish/subscripe networks and event
sources.<br>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">Internally,
YANCEES is a framework that combines:</p>


<blockquote>
  
  <p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"> <span lang="en-us">1. Dynamic
parsers that&nbsp;allocate plug-ins to
cope with the provided subscription and notification commands/policies.<br>


2. Input and output filters<br>


3. Special pluggable services<br>


4. Configuration managers and builders<br>


5. Adapters that can support existing
publish/subscribe networks<br>


6. A core that integrates those featues.</span></p>


</blockquote>


By combining different features
impelmented by means of plug-ins, filters and protocols, YANCEES allows
the built of application-specific notifications services. The general
approach is described in the following figure.<br>

<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">Many
distributed applications interact by the exchange of events.
For the point of view of the applications, notification services
provide a distributed implementation of the
implicit
invocation pattern, intermediating the communication between
publishers of
information and their consumers (subscribers). In such systems, at one
side, publishers produce pieces of information that are sent (or
published) to a logically-centralized service (a.k.a.notification
service); whereas information consumers (or subscribers)
express their interest on those pieces of informationby means of
subscriptions. Subscriptions are usually represented
as logical expressions on the content, type and/or order of events.
More
advanced systems allow more expressive constructs, permitting the
correlation of events, for example. This
approach allows the insulation between producers and consumers of
information, which copes with the dynamism, heterogeneity, scalability
and changeability requirements of many distributed applications. The
publish/subscribe
communication style also facilitates the
combination and integration of information from different sources as
they get produced.<br>


</p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us">For having such characteristics, event
notification servers have been used as the basic communication
infrastructure in a
large set of application domains. These domains
include
user and software monitoring, testing, <a href="http://elvin.dstc.edu.au/index.html">CSCW</a>, <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/cassius/">awareness</a>,
workflow management systems, mobile
applications,
enterprise integration, software engineering environments and so on.
Due to their
increasing popularity and the peculiarities of each application domain,
different functinality has been demanded from such
infrastructures.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">
<span lang="en-us">Even though a big
set of commercial and research notification services are currently
available,
they
are not usually designed for evolution and configurabilty. In other
words, they provide poor programability, configurability and dynamic
change&nbsp;support.
From a software engineer perspective, before YANCEES, developers had
basically three options when using notification services in their
applications:</span></p>


<ul>


  <li>
    
    <p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"> <span lang="en-us">Use what
we call &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; or
monolythic
approaches, such as
adopted by <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/notification_service.htm">CORBA
Notification Service (CORBA-NS), </a>READY or JMS. These
infrastructures strive to address new applications requirements by
providing, in advance, a very
comprehensive set of features. Besides their inability to scale (down)
to more
simple applications, they are not designed with extensibility in mind.
As applications evolve demand new requirements, the
infrastructure itself cannot evolve to address these new
requirements.</span> </p>


  </li>


  <li>
    
    <p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"> <span lang="en-us">Use
specialized notification services, designed for
different application domains. Also motivated by the poor versatility
of current standardized solutions such as CORBA-NS or JMS, many
notification services have been
developed to provide novel but specific
functionalities demanded by different applications.
Examples of such specialized systems include KHRONIKA and <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/cassius/">CASSIUS</a>
which
are specially designed to support groupware and awareness applications;
or YEAST and GEM which are specialized in advanced event
processing for local networks
applications, or JEDI, which first studies strategies to support
mobility in publish/subscribe systems. Moreover, those infrastructures
are usually implement incompatible and
non-programmable solutions, which in a big organization result in
incompatibilty and interoperability problems, since&nbsp; different
notification services may need to co-exist and inter-operate.<br>


    </span></p>


  </li>


  <li>
    
    <p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us">In a third
and emerging category, notification services
such as <a href="http://serl.cs.colorado.edu/%7Ecarzanig/siena/software/index.html">Siena</a>
or <a href="http://elvin.dstc.com/index.html">Elvin</a>
can be used.
They provide a minimal core of features in a
content-based network. A compromise between expressiveness and
performance is achieved in favor of
its scalability, providing an optimized content-based event routing
network. Due to their emphases on fast and scalable routing of events,
they
provide a simple but efficient filtering language.
Configurability&nbsp;programability is not their primary concerns,
being the responsibility of
the application to implement extra services such as event persistence,
and advanced event correlation, for example.</span></p>


  </li>


</ul>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">
<span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configurabilty:
Specialization versus Generalization.</span> Therefore, in the
development of event driven distributed applications, developers face
the dilemma of
specialization versus generalization: to use a generalized
infrastructure, that
can support and integrate different applications, but that may not
provide all the
necessary functionality (in terms of subscription language,
notification policies and other points of variance in notification
services); or to
use specialized
event-based infrastructures for each application domain, having
&#8220;the
right tool
for the right problem&#8221;, but loosing the uniformity and
integration of a
common
solution. For example, in the development of awareness tools, one can
use either
a comprehensive solution such as CORBA Notification Service (CORBA-NS)
that
provides a large set of features and services, or a domain specific
solution
such as <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/cassius/">CASSIUS</a>,
that provides services for awareness applications.
That&#8217;s
important to note that infrastructures as CORBA-NS, even though are
very
comprehensive in its set of features, do not provide specific support
for
all the
requirements of many specific application domains. For example, in the
case of
awareness
applications, CORBA-NS does not provide event source hierarchy
representation, browsing and discovery. CASSIUS, on the other
hand, provides these features and allows the easy discovery of
information sources
and the subscription for events from different source components. If
CORBA-NS
were used in an awareness application demanding this feature, this
service would
need to be implemented by the system developers, in the application
layer.</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">
<span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Processing
distribution.</span>
Another problem
of the currently available event-based infrastructures is the poor
support for
selection and customization of where to execute the&nbsp; event
processing computation.
Few notification services, such as READY, provide this support. READY
extends the CORBA-NS, allowing
subscription processing to be done in the client side. <br>


</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Infrastructure
Evolution.</span>
Moreover,
current
event-based infrastructures lack mechanisms that allow the programming
(or evolution)
of
their
functionality. The only extension mechanism is usually the
(understanding and)
change of the notification service source code, or the implementation
of the missing functionality as part of the application itself.
Additionally, due to restrictions in their event or
subscription models, the addition of new functionality may become a
very
time consuming and difficult task.</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scalabilty</span>.
Different applications demand different functionality sets from the
publish/subscribe infrastructure. Moreover, they have different
hardware requirements, requiring the support for device-constrained
configurations such as PDAs, or more demanding server-side
applications. &nbsp;Hence, infrastructures that allow the scale (up
and
down) of their features to different application requirements are not
available.</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interoperabilty.</span>
Interoperability issues may also be a problem. In large organizations,
for example, if
multiple notification services are used in the support for different
application domains, their integration may be an
issue. They are usually
incompatible with one another and do not easily
interoperate, as a result of different event syntax and semantic, as
well as subscription formats.<br>


</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamism.</span> In order
to be useful, the
configurability and programmabilty aspects need to&nbsp; be
provided in
a way that does not inerrupt the publish/subscribe infrastructure. This
requires the ability to
dinamically configure/upgrade the system as&nbsp; required by the
addplicatoins. <br>


<span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Usability</span>.
Another important aspect to be considered is usabilty. A notification
service must be easy to use, in the point of view of the programmers,
providing services that allow, for example, the registration and
discovery of new event souces, as a way to enhance the subscription
ability of the service.<br>


</span></p>


Based on those requirements, <span style="font-weight: bold;">versatility</span>
is then defined as the ability of providing those characteristics. In
order to study the application of those issues in a publish/subscribe
context, we developed <span lang="en-us">YANCEES, a
prototype that
embodies our approach. YANCEES&nbsp; provides one common and
programmable
publish/subscribe framework to address the versatility aspects
previously described. Programability is provided by
plug-ins
and&nbsp;
the&nbsp; event, notification, subscription and protocol languages.
Configurability is achieved by the use of configuration managers and
the ability to distribute plug-ins throughout client and server sides.
Dynamism is
achieved by dynamic parsers, that allocate plug-ins on demand, and by
the architecture manager, that allows the upgrade and installation of
new
plug-in implementations. Reuse is achieved by the composition of
existing plug-ins. YANCEES can also be used to integrate existing
content-based routing networks such as Siena and Elvin by using them as
internal dispatchers. Or it can also be be used as an abstraction layer
around these networks, enhancing their
subscription languages with more expressive filters, and event
correlation capabilities, moving the advanced event
processing and delivery burden from the client to the middleware. <br>

<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">
<span lang="en-us">In order to design a generic and
programmable
framework, the application domain must be understood. This requirements
analysis must lay out the main activities involved in the process being
automated, allowing the generalization of the solution through the
implementation of an object-oriented framework. In other words, a
framework must provide extensibilty along the main dimension of the
problem being generalized.<br>


</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"><span lang="en-us">In the YANCEES
framework, the programability points are inspired in the framework
proposed
by <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Edsr/Publications/esec97.html">(Rosenblum
and
Wolf 1997)</a>, which captures the most relevant dimensions (or
models)
in the design
of publish/subscribe services. In this framework, the <i style="">object
model</i> describes the components that receive notifications
(subscribers) and
generate events (publishers). The <i style="">event
model</i> describes the representation and characteristics of the
events; the <i style="">notification

the

the <i style="">observation model</i> describes the

the

<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">
<span lang="en-us">For the implementation of YANCEES, we

variation of this model proposed by </span><span class="m"><span class="h">
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/32.950318">(Cugola,
Nitto, and Fuggetta 2001)</a>, with the addition of</span></span><span lang="en-us"> a new model, the protocol. The protocol model
is defined
as a way to address the need to capture
other forms of interaction with the notification service that goes
beyond the common publish/subscribe
interaction. This is necessary to incorporate the ability to handle
different functionality other than the common publish and subscribe
activities, and that require the interaction of the publish/subscribe
core with other components of the system. Examples of protocols that
may be necessary are:
guaranteed delivery, mobility and roaming protocols,
security, event source discovery and other possible interaction
mechanisms with
the service.</span></p>


<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">The
YANCEES strategy to provide programability and configurability is to
implement these models as programmable points along an object-oriented

location of the plug-ins can also be achieved.</span></p>


<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">Filters
and services are used to
enhance the functionality
provided by the plug-ins. Filters process events in the input and
output streams
of the framework, allowing the implementation of security policies,
event type checking and so on; services can be used to provide access
points to shared
resources such
as databases, data models, and so on.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
arrival of a message
(subscription arrow in the picture) triggers the appropriate
parser (Subscriber API), which identifies the XML tags of the message.
In the example
above, we assume a subscription message&nbsp; having two parts, a
subscription expression and a notification policy. The subscriber API
splits the message in their two components, forwarding each part to the
appropriate parser, in this case, the notification and the subscription
parsers. Each parser allocates plug-in
instances to handle the commands expressed in each part of the message.
An
evaluation tree, composed of plug-in instances, is then created, in
memory, to handle (or interpret) that particular
message. The tree is composed of notification and subscription nodes.
The leaves of this tree are special plug-ins that subscribe to events
in the dispatcher. Plug-is more close to the top of the tree perform
higher-level computations, such as event sequence detection. Once the
tree is parsed, events coming from the dispatcher that matches the
leaves subscriptions are processed, in a bottom-up approach, through
this structure, having the results sent to the subscriber as
notifications. Before delivering the notifications, the message passes
through output filters that enforce global policies in the system. Note
that while subscriptions are handled on demand, and are associated to
unique subscribers, filters are applied to all the events of the system.<br>


</span></p>


<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
basic parsing algorithm,
which
is also applied to the notification, subscription and protocol models,
is

<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">Plug-ins
associated to each tag
of
the message (subscription in our example) are allocated according to
their disposition in the XML model (or document) where they are
represented. Each plug-in instance handles one or more XML tags in the
message being
parsed.
Events are sent upward in the subscription tree as the plug-ins
expressions are
evaluated.</span></p>

<span lang="en-us">YANCEES can be configured to
dynamically install

help of the configuration protocol.&nbsp;</span>
<h2 align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><a name="Implementation">Implementation
Status</a></span></h2>


<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
YANCEES prototype was
implemented and tested with Java (J2SDK1.4.2 and WSDP1.2 - which
provides XMLSchema validation support for the DOM parser). Currently,
the framework supports
the core mechanisms presented in the previous sections: input and
output filters, subscription, notification and protocol plug-ins, and
shared services, which can be configured at boot time with the use of
configuration description files. The system was ported to work using
Siena and
Elvin. It also supports our own fast topic-based dispatcher. The
communication between client stubs and the
server
is implemented using Java RMI protocol.<br>


</span></p>


<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
following plug-ins are
implemented: event sequence
detection, pull and push notification policies, polling protocol, a
simple
persistence service (in memory), a fast multiplexer dispatcher
(topic-based), and many other features. <br>


</span></p>


<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
service is multithreaded and
supports many simultaneous subscriptions and publications as
non-blocking operations. Input and output buffers were implemented to
improve overall throughput and performance.<br>


</span></p>


<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">In the
next releases of YANCEES,
we plan to improve the architecture with:<br>


</span></p>


<ul>


  <li>Improved <span lang="en-us">end-user

  <li><span lang="en-us">Finer-grained distribution
