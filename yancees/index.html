<h2><b style=""><a name="Principles"></a>YANCEES
Architectural Design
Principles</b></h2>

According
to the <i style="">Cambridge Advanced Learner&#8217;s
Dictionary</i>, versatility is the ability <i style="">&#8220;to
change easily from one activity to another&#8221; </i>or the ability<i style=""> &#8220;to be used for many different purposes.&#8221;</i>
In the context of software engineering, versatility is a
computational system charactetistic that allows its use in multiple contexts, by easily supporting the
requirements of different application domains. Hence, from a software
engineering
perspective, and more specifically in the context of publish/subscribe
infrastructures,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">versatility is the ability of software
systems to withstand the diversity and constant evolution of
application domain requirements in a useful and usable way</span>.
Our experience with YANCEES shows that versatility is achieved though
the proper&nbsp;application of specialization, generalization,
variation, extensibiliy and configurability in
the construction of usable and useful infrastructures that can support
the
variability and evolution of an application domain.<br>
<br>in YANCEES, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">versatility</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
is achieved through the proper combination of the following <span style="font-weight: bold;">software
engineering&nbsp; principles</span>: 1) separation
of concerns as the criteria </span>of
modularization; 2) design for change
(extensibility and configurability) around stable publish/subscribe
infrastructures design dimensions; 3)
generality to reduce
complexity induced by dependency-driven incompatibilities;&nbsp; 4) abstraction in the
development of domain-specific subscription and notification languages, thus better supporting end users;
5)&nbsp;optional reuse of existing infrastructures ; 6) and improved usability trhough automation and simplicity.
These principles are explained
as follows.<br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></small></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
</span></small></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Separation of concerns</span>.
the design of YANCEES applied separation of concerns as the criteria
for
modularization, defining stable interfaces and modules "around"
assumptions that are more likely to change <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=800054.801999">[Parnas,
72]</a>.
Hence, The variability of features in the publish/subscribe domain is
centered
on the way events are represented (event model); the way events are
filtered and routed (subscription and routing models)&nbsp;; the
way
events
are delivered (notification model) and additional interaction ways with
the
infrastructure, for example: event source browsing, mobility support
and others. These main
variability dimensions are chosen as the&nbsp;variation points in
YANCEES. These variation points define component models that support
the definition of modular units of variation and extension supporting
reuse. Separation of concerns is also applied in the use of multiple
interfaces: end-user publish/subscribe interface and extension
interface, targeted to developers.<br>
<b style=""><br>
Anticipation of change. </b>The
support for different application requirements is achieved by the use
of a flexible component framework that supports configurability and
extensibility
along the main variability dimensions (design concerns) of
publish/subscribe infrastructures. Component frameworks support
configurability and extensibility as follows.<br>
<ul>
<li><b style="">Configurability. </b>It
is usually the case that application domains require only a sub-set of
features of an infrastructure. Configurability supports the
coherent&nbsp;
combination of publish/subscribe characteristics into
application-specific infrastructures. This
not only allows the
tailoring of the infrastructure to the specific requirements of
specific application domains, but also helps in the reduction of the
footprint of the
infrastructure for cases where memory and CPU resources are scarce, for
example: PDAs.<br></li>
<li><b style="">Extensibility.</b>
The constant evolution of application domain requirements make the
construction of one-size-fits-all approaches with fixed set of features
inadequate. In order to support unforeseeable requirements, the main
design
dimensions of pub/sub infrastructures must be extensible. In YANCEES,
the extensibility
is supported along the main variability dimensions of publish/subscribe
infrastructures according to &nbsp;their component models.<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generality.</span>
One way to minimize the impact of dependencies, their configuration
management costs, and incompatibility problems is to adopt general and
fixed data representation. Central features such as the event format,
which
changes can virtually impact all other variability dimensions, need to
be
generalized. As such, In YANCEES, the default event
model is represented by a tuple-based (attribute/value) abstraction,
and the default subscription
model is
content-based. Generalization broadens reuse, requiring fewer
adaptations of existing plug-ins
(for the few cases where these models do not apply). As a rule, we use
stability (the ratio between incoming and the total dependencies of a
design dimension) as the criteria for selecting the dimension to
generalize.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstraction.</span> The
ability to define domain-specific subscription and
notification languages support application developers by reducing the
cognitive distance involved in the development of event-driven
applications. In other words, the ability to extend and configure the
subscription and notification languages, as well as the event, routing
and protocol models, frees the application developers from tasks
associated to data format adaptation and the complexity of implementing
domain-specific features.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reuse.</span>
Finally, YANCEES not only supports the reuse of its many components,
but can also the reuse of existing infrastructures such as Siena,
Elvin and others as a way to achieve interoperability with existing
publish/subscribe networks. Another goal of reuse is to leverage on the
features provided by existing generalized infrastructures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Usability.</span> In order to be useful and fulfill its purpose, software must be usable.
From the software consumers perspective, the usability in
YANCEES&nbsp;
is a consequence of the application of abstraction, separation of
concerns and automation.
Abstraction comes from the use of high-level subscription and
notification languages, and a simple client-side API that hides from
the users concerns related to: the runtime selection, initialization
and configuration of components that implement the features required by
end-users. The ability to hide these concerns from the end-users comes
from the application of automation. Finally, separation of extension
and usage concerns provide multiple interfaces to support both
infrastructure developers and infrastructure users.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simplicity</span>.
Complexity is the major source of problems in software development.
Approaches that minimize complexity result in more efficient,
evolvable, less prone to errors solution. In order to escape the
one-size-fits-all syndom where the addition of many variables in the
system increases its complexity, configuration costs and even affect
its performance, YANCEES is built as a simple core around which
different extensions and optional plug-ins are installed.  </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taming the
Costs of Versatility</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
application of these principles, while increasing the infrastructure
versatility, come at the expense of extra complexity due to the following facts: 1) The different publish/subscribe
concerns are not orthogonal. In other words, they participate in the
process of publishing, routing and notifying events, which define
<span style="font-weight: bold;">implicit semantic data
and control dependencies</span>
between these components. For example, the use of a global event
representation, and assumptions about event frequency, creates
oportunities for feature interaction.&nbsp; 2)
Moreover, complex features are built from a combination of different
components, that&nbsp;need to communicate, defining <span style="font-weight: bold;">explicit dependencies</span>
between different parts (and components) of the system. 3) The <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic characteristic of the
publish/subscribe model</span>
require additional support for run-time allocation of components in
response to client's needs. 4) Finally, the reuse of existing
infrastructures require support for adaptation. In order to
address requirements, the following strategies are adopted in YANCEES:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b style="">Automation of user
interaction and infrastructure build process</b> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(static variability management)</span>.
Even though the different concerns of publish/subscribe systems can
&nbsp;be separated into different variability dimensions. It is
usually
the case that these concerns are not completely orthogonal. In other
words, components are implemented in the context of a predefined
configuration. As a result, changes in one dimension may affect other
dimensions. For
example,
content-based subscription is directly dependent on the event format;
advanced event processing (for e.g.&nbsp;sequence detection), is
dependent on timing assumptions induced by different&nbsp;routing
protocols, filters and subscription languages. If not properly enforced
and documented, changes in apparently unrelated features may
interfere with each order. As a consequence these fundamental problem
dependencies must be adequately managed. Two main strategies are
adopted to manage these issues: indirection, documentation and
automation.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Indirection. </span>&nbsp;One
way to prevent the ripple effect of changes in different parts of
software is the use of standardized interfaces and decision points
where component-specific adaptations can be performed. These points
apply the information hiding principle, defining stable interfaces
that are implemented by different components.&nbsp; In YANCEES this
is achieved by the use of standard component model interfaces, the use
of adapters, and the application of the factory design pattern as a
mediator to the creation of plug-ins at runtime. The factory design
pattern supports component parametrization, allowing components to be
tailored to a particular runtime context at the time they are created.<br></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Documentation</span>.
The dependencies between the components of the system must be made
explicit in order to prevent misconfiguration. In YANCEES, this
information can be defined in a configuration file, allowing the
automatic checking of dependencies.<br></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automation. </span>Without
automation, the process of configuring and
building a versatile
infrastructure can become overly complex and error-prone.
In YANCEES, configuration managers and dynamic parsers are used to
integrate and
automatically load user-required features, supporting the management
of feature dependencies, preventing inconsistent configurations and
allowing the runtime construction of user-tailored subscriptions.
Hence, differently from variation-based infrastructures such
as&nbsp;CORBA-NS where the user needs to navigate through a
hierarchy
of
objects in order to assemble subscriptions, YANCEES strives to simplify
the
user interaction with the infrastructure through the use of
subscription and notification languages
that express the queries in the event model. It also adopt a
configuration language dedicated to express the different
configurations and dependencies between&nbsp;components. <o:p></o:p></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b style="">Dynamism (dynamic variability management).</b>
Publish/subscribe infrastructures are inherently interactive.
Subscriptions are user-defined logical expressions on the order or
content of events. As such, they are directly dependent on the
features provided by the infrastructure. Subscriptions are also
dynamic, being posted and removed at runtime by different users. Hence,
In order to support the many possible combinations of features a server
may have, and the intrinsic interactivity of the publish/subscribe
model, YANCEES support&nbsp;runtime loading and assembling of
features.
A valid subscription is a word in the subscription language installed
in YANCEES, and can be expressed in terms of different commands.Hence,
subscriptions are used to orchestrate the composition of plug-ins at
runtime. This strategy not only copes with
configurability and customization, by also supports the co-existence of
different
feature sets in the same infrastructure, for example: content-based and
fast
topic-based subscriptions can be supported, at the same time in
YANCEES. Finally, this strategy promotes a more rational allocation
of
resources: features are loaded on demand, copying with more
restricted
environments such as PDAs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reflexive Architecture.&nbsp;</span>
A consequence of the different data and control dependencies between
the publish/subscribe variability dimensions is that complex features
are usually implemented by the combination of different plug-ins. For
example, event persistence, mobility protocols and others. Since most
of these plug-ins are dynamically allocated, they need to locate each
other, at runtime, in order to communicate. As a consequence, YANCEES
supports&nbsp;runtime plug-in location through
the use of a plug-in registry. A plug-in registry provides a single
point of access to all the active components in the infrastructure. It
supports name-based access to&nbsp;active plug-ins,&nbsp;at any
given
moment in time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for Adaptation</span>. The optional reuse of existing infrastructures such as Siena
and Elvin as a way to achieve interoperability or to reduce the
development costs associated to the routing model, requires means to
convert YANCEES internal model (event representation, subscription and
notification languages) to existing infrastructures. In YANCEES this is
achieved by the use of adapters in the dispatcher model.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for Different Interfaces</span>.
Infrastructure users and infrastructure developers have different needs
with respect to the way they must interact with the infrastructure.
While the users are interested in selecting and utilizing the features
provided by the infrastructure. Developers are interested in extending
and configuring the infrastructure to meet different user needs. In the
support for these different roles, YANCEES provides different
interfaces. The goal is to simplify the interaction with the system
exposing only the necessary API to each king of user. The supported
APIs are: Publication and Subscription API, used by application
developers; and the Extension and Configuratoin API used by the
develpers. &nbsp;Strategy selection is implicitly supported by the
subscription language, at runtime, which allows subscribers to select
different commands according to their need. For example: content-based
or topic-based filtering.</p>
<h2><b><b style=""><a name="Benefits"></a>YANCEES
Benefits</b></b></h2>
YANCEES
incorporates these principles and strategies in a component framework
illustrated as
follows: the core components are extended and configured by
user-defined plug-ins,
filters and adapters. Subscription and notification models are defined
according
to extensible languages, that guide, and restrict, the process of
runtime composition
of subscription and notification plug-ins. Existing publish/subscribe
infrastructures such as Siena or Elvin can be reused as routing
components (or overlays). &nbsp;These components are integrated
according to a configuration file (architecture description) that
checks
for coherent composition of plug-ins. The resulting infrastructure is
loaded, supporting the combined features.<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><o:p></o:p></span>

</span>By combining different features
implemented by means of plug-ins, filters and protocols, YANCEES allows
the built of application-specific notifications services. In so doing,
it provides the following benefits:<br>
<br>
-
Support for the right ammount of featues to the application domain,
resulting in a
reduced footprint, which can support environment &nbsp;restricted
application domains.<br>
- Support for subscription languages that
match the exact need of the application, thus raising the abstraction
of the infrastructure API, and reducing the cognitive
distance between the infrastructure and the application domain.<br>
-
Reuse of existing features, implemented as plug-ins, servies and

of novel publish/sbscribe infrastructures.<br>
- Reduced development time and incresed reusability from the point of
view of application developers.<br>
-&nbsp;Interoperability
with existing publish/subscribe infrastructures such as Elvin and
Siena. These infrastructures can be reused as publish/subscribe cores
in YANCEES.<br>- Better evolvability: features can be added, removed and updated, according to the chaning needs of a domain<br>-
Better maintainability: the modularization provided by the plug-in
model allow a better isolation of components, facilitating the

<h2><a name="Design"></a>Component Framework

YANCEES supports the extension and
configuration of different publish/subscribe infrastructures features
along main variation/extension points in the infrastructure. These
points are:<br>
<br>
1) The <span style="font-weight: bold;">subscription</span>
model, which defines the way information consumers express interest on
events<br>
2) The <span style="font-weight: bold;">notification</span>

5)
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">routing</span>
model, which permits the implementation of different

others.<br>

<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify">Internally,
YANCEES is provide a set of component frameworks that combine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="EstiloAntes6ptDepoisde0ptKernem14pt" align="justify"> <span lang="en-us">1. Dynamic
parsers that&nbsp;allocate plug-ins according to user-provided
subscriptions subscription and notification commands.<br>
2. Input and output publication filters as a way to intercept event

3. Special static plug-ins that implement services, for example: mDNS
and persistence<br>
4. Configuration managers, dynamic parsers and builders that

5. Adapters that can support existing
publish/subscribe infrastructures, for ex: Siena, Elvin and custom-made
cores<br>
6. A set of component frameworks that provides interfaces and
composition rules
on the different variation points.</span></p>
</blockquote>
A
component framework defines standard interfaces, composition mechamisns
and&nbsp;common data representations. YANCEES has specific
component
models for each one of its variability dimensions. Threee major
composition mechanisms and interfaces are defined. The
communication between plug-ins in the subscription, notification and
routing models is achieved by the use of the listener design pattern;
by the pipe-and-filter design pattern in the case of input and output
filters; and by standard interfaces in the case of services and
dispatchers.
Subscription and Notification plug-ins are therefore composed with one
another by registering
themselves as each other's listeners; whereas filters are composed by
connecting their standard input with a standar output of other filter.
Services do not prescribe any particular interface. Their integration
with other components is mediated by the plug-in registry component,
that permits different pllug-ins to locate each other by name
references. In most of the cases, however, the composition
process&nbsp;is automated. For example, subscription and
notification
plug-ins are composed, at runtime, through a subscription parsing
engine, according to the provided subscription/notification expression
which is defined according to the grammar rules of subscription and
notification languages. Finally, the event model is extensible. Events
are generic objects, which methods and/or content must be especialized
by YANCEES users.<br>
<br>
These main components and APIs are presented in Figure 2 as follows.

YANCEES architecture with plug-ins (in red) and main
extension/variation points and APIs (in blue)</p></blockquote>
In sum, the unifying composition approach adopted by YANCEES component
model is the listener pattern. &nbsp;Components are both producers and
consumers of event, allowing multiple consumers to listen to existing
components. Components also have a management interface that allow
their runtime composition into listener hierarchies.
<h2><a name="Design"></a>Evaluation</h2>
YANCEES was used in the implementation of different applications, as
part of the <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/swirl/">Swirl</a>
project and as part of the evaluation of IC server, the infrastructure
behind <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/454/geyer.html">Activity
Explorer</a>. We also conducted a comparative analysis of the benefits and
costs of using YANCEES as compared to other approaches. The results of
this study are available in the <a href="http://awareness.ics.uci.edu/%7Ersilvafi/tradeoffs/">website</a> and in an <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech_reports/UCI-ISR-09-3.pdf">ISR technical report</a>.<br>

<h2><span lang="en-us"><a name="Implementation"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prototype
Implementation</span></a></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
YANCEES prototype was
implemented and tested with Java (J2SDK1.4.2 and WSDP1.2 - which
provides XMLSchema validation support for the DOM parser). Currently,
the framework supports
the core mechanisms presented in the previous sections: input and
output filters, subscription, notification and protocol plug-ins, and
shared services, which can be configured at boot time with the use of
configuration description files. The system was ported to work using
Siena and
Elvin. It also supports our own fast topic-based dispatcher. The
communication between client stubs and the
server
is implemented using Java RMI protocol.<br>
</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
following plug-ins are
implemented: event sequence
detection, pull and push notification policies, polling protocol, a
simple
persistence service (in memory), a fast multiplexer dispatcher
(topic-based), and many other features. <br>
</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The
service is multi threaded and
supports many simultaneous subscriptions and publications as
non-blocking operations. Input and output buffers were implemented to
improve overall throughput and performance.<br>
