Dear Roberto, Cleidson and David,

The program committee for the Twelfth ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on
Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) met recently to consider
your submission.  Your paper titled

"Striving for Versatility in Event Notification Services"

was carefully reviewed by at least three program committee members. 
The committee decided that your paper will not be included in this
year's program. As I'm sure you know FSE is a highly-selective
meeting and this year only 25 out of 169 submissions were accepted.  

The reviewers spent considerable time reading your paper and writing
reviews; the reviews are attached below. I urge you to consider
those reviews carefully as they contain advice on how to address
problematic issues with your research results and to improve the
quality of your presentation. If you are new to the FSE community,
I urge to read selected papers from past FSE proceedings to gain an
understanding of the quality of results and presentation that are
typical of the meeting. This will help when you submit your work in
the future.

FSE will be held in Newport Beach, California at the beginning of
November this year.  It will be preceded and followed by a lineup
of very interesting workshops (see the conference web-site for
details). SIGSOFT week as a whole promises a wealth of interesting 
technical material and a healthy dose of pleasant California beach
weather; I encourage you to attend.

Best Regards

Matthew B. Dwyer
FSE 2004 Program Chair

First reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

 The paper proposes YANCEES, an extensible and configure event service
 framework. The authors motivate the proposed framework by observing that
 current event services are either not extensible or do not include
 capabilities needed by many applications. Thus, developers have to
 build event services from scratch or modify the source code of existing
 services. The YANCEES framework addresses this concern by providing a
 pluggable architecture to allows new plugs-in to be defined and inserted
 into the event notification paths. A new protocol dimension is added
 to address concerns other than simple subscription and notification.
 Two cases studies have been presented which sketch how YANCEES can be
 customized to specific applications.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

 The paper addresses an important problem of designing an event service
 that can be customized to specific applications. I have the
 suggestions for improvements:

 1. The paper does not present concrete details about the proposed framework.
 The details are mostly discussed at the conceptual level. For example,
 the authors talk about the distribution configurability (ability to
 specify which parts of the service execute on the server side and which
 on the client side), but there is no concrete discussion on how this
 is specified or implemented except mentioning that client and server
 side plugins can be defined.

 2. The paper does not refer to some recent work on extensible event
 communication frameworks. For example, the
 FACET framework (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~doc/RandD/PCES/facet) based on
 aspect oriented programming accomplishes many of the goals of this paper.

 3. The section, Performance Tests, needs to be expanded. For
 example, the metric "subscriptions/second" is not clear. Does it
 imply a sequence of subscribe and unsubscribe calls ? How many clients
 are subscribing ? Are the clients and servers running on the same
 machine ? Also, it is not clear how many producers and
 consumers were used in the experiments. The authors need to present
 a more detailed evaluation.

 4. In the first case study, the authors should provide some concrete
 numbers using metrics such as the number of lines of code that the user
 had to write to customize YANCEES to the specific application.
 For example, how complex is the CassiusService component (the
 discussion says that it handles creation and management of objects,
 accounts, and their events which sounds complex) ?
 It would have been also useful if the authors could briefly discuss
 what modifications are needed in an existing event service (such as SIENA)
 to customize it for the same application.

Second reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

The paper describes YANCEES (Yet ANother Configurable Extensible Event
Service), a framework designed to address versatility in
publish/subscribe systems. YANCEES is implemented as a layer on top of
a generic existing event notification middleware, allowing its
extension in term of new services. The paper shows how to use YANCEES
for implementing new services and provides an evaluation comparing the
YANCEES performances with different under-layer protocols.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

Favour:

The authors applied a plug-in design to the event-based world providing a
solution that allows versatility and adaptability.

The Paper is clear and well written. The overall idea is clearly
described and many implementation details are well explained.

Against:

The authors miss an important point of comparison with systems like FACET.
They should address this issue and try to emphasize and better characterize
their approach wrt the existing literature.


The authors do not explicitly mention that YANCEES is build on top of
existing event-notification services. Moreover, it is not clear if and
how YANCESS respects the requirements posed by the under-layer
framework. That is, does it preserve the semantics defined by the used
framework? For example, Siena and Elvin subscription/unsubscription
semantics are quite different. In fact while Siena implements a
complex subscription logic based on the filter-covering and posets
theory, Elvin implements a naive solution. 

I would like to see a comparative benchmark using YANCEES and JMS.

Section 5: 
	(last paragraph) What does LOC mean? 

Section 6: 
 * table 2, cell (4,1): subscirp. --> subscrip. 
 * It is not clear how the performance tests have been computed:
  - In both Siena and Elvin the event-service can be implemented in
  either a centralized or distributed way: What is the experimental
  setup used for these measurements?
  - The authors do not explain what "ability of processing
  subscriptions" means and how they have measured it. i.e. In Siena
  a subscription is fully processed when it is active; Then this
  implies that a subscription is active only after it has been
  (eventually) forwarded through the event-service.

Third reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

This paper describes the design, implementation, and
qualitative/quantitative evaluation of YANCEES, which is 
a flexible event service implementation written in Java and XML.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

+ The paper is based on an actual event service implementation and 
 quantitative/qualitative evaluations of this implementation.
 
- The paper doesn't provide a significant contribution to the
 extensive research on these topics.
 
- Paper isn't very well written, i.e., needs a careful proof reading. 
 
The following are suggestions for improving this paper:

Section 1

. The authors' aren't clear what they mean when they say "CORBA-NS
 does not support mobility protocols, and the addition of such
 feature (sic) usually requires changing its source code or the
 implementation of this concern by the client application." Mobility
 protocols are indeed supported in CORBA (see the work on Extensible
 Transport Frameworks and the Wireless/Mobile Special Interest Group
 in the OMG for details), but they are supported at the ORB-level,
 not the Service-level. I recommend the authors come up with a
 better example to illustrate their point.
 
. There has been extensive work on highly flexible event services
 based on standards. A good example is the FACET work by Ron Cytron
 and Frank Hunleth at Washington University, which uses AspectJ to be
 able to add/subtract event service features in a very fine-grained
 level.

 I recommend the authors cite this work since they have already
 addressed the main topics of this paper in detail several years ago.
 
. It's not really clear from this section what the key *research*
 contributions of this paper are, i.e., what are the hard open
 problems in this area and how does this paper provide a significant
 contribution. I recommend the authors revise the intro to clearly
 explain this since otherwise it's not really clear what makes this a
 research paper.
 
Section 2

. One of the most important requirements on an event service is
 "quality of service" (e.g., scalability, reliability,
 predictability, etc.). Without considering this capability in the
 context of the other "ility" requirements listed in this section
 it's hard to imagine an event service being very useful in practice.
 I recommend the authors explain how their approach effects quality
 of service since there are often important tradeoffs between it and
 the versability requirements.
 
Section 3
 
. The way in which this section is written makes the paper seem
 EXTREMELY incremental, i.e., it's basically saying that "our work
 extends Rosenblum and Wolf's work to add one new property "the
 protocol". It's entirely unclearly, however, why adding this
 particularly property represents a contribution to research on event
 services since there has been considerable work already done on
 addressing protocol-related issues in the context of event
 services. examples of this type of work include

 }
 
Sections 4 and 5
 
. It's hard to tell from the discussion in these sections what is
 actually novel/new in the approach to implementing YANCEES since all
 of the approaches sound very straightforward and similar to related
 work. I recommend the authors clearly explain what is novel/new in
 their approach and also describe what are the hard parts of what
 they are doing, i.e., they need to justify why this isn't all just
 straightforward engineering work.
 
Section 6 
 
. These empirical results really aren't interesting since they are
 simply measuring the performance of YANCEES rather than evaluating
 its *versatility*. The key selling point for YANCEES is clearly not
 raw performance (otherwise, it wouldn't be written in Java and
 XML). Therefore, any novelty it has must stem from its versability,
 which is not actually evaluated in the performance tests. Moreover,
 the results don't really provide any insights into novel/new
 optimization techniques used to alleviate performance bottlenecks in
 event service systems.
 
Section 7
 
. This section does a nice job of illustrating how YANCEES can be used
 in practice. Given the preponderance of other published work that
 illustrates how to configure flexible event service implementations,
 however, this section doesn't really represent a signficant
 contribution. Moreover, these case studies are only on prototypes
 developed by the authors, rather than being used in large-scale
 production systems (unlike other published work on flexible event
 services), so that minimizes the opportunity to present results
 based on lessons learned from actual experience in real-world
 systems.
 
Section 8 
 
. As mentioned earlier, the paper doesn't discuss significant related
 work on event services. 
 
Section 9

. It would be useful to add a summary of "lessons learned" at the end
 of the paper.
