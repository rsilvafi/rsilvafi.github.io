<h1>Research</h1>
My research so
far has focused on the construction and the empirical evaluation of
collaborative tools and their underlying infrastructures. My goal is
to&nbsp;better support the
different needs of infrastructure developers, application engineers and
end-users through the application of cuttig-edge software engineering
technologies. As such, I've been conducting research in the areas of:
publish/subscribe infrastructures, distributed collaborative software
engineering, usable security, awareness, ubiquitous computing,
contextual collaboration and
software product lines.<br />

In spite of the modularization benefits supported by the
Aspect-Oriented
programming paradigm, different usability issues have hindered its
adoption. The decoupling between aspect definitions and base code, and
the
compile-time weaving mechanism adopted by different AOP languages,
require
developers to manage the consistency between base code and aspect code
themselves. These mechanisms create opportunities for errors related to
aspect weaving invisibility and non-local control characteristics of
AOP
languages. In short, AOP developers lack adequate support for: 1)
visualizing and identifying the exact points in the code where aspects
are
woven; 2) preventing aspect-base code inconsistencies, and 3) evolving
aspect-oriented code in a coherent way. <br />
<br />
In
this research, we study the
use of IDE automation in the&nbsp;supports developers in managing
these
issues
in the functional aspect-oriented programming domain. XE is a prototype
implementing: in-line edit-time weaving (a.k. a.. fluid AOP), a
relational
model that keeps aspect-base code consistency, and a set of
visualizations that help developers identify and manage the
co-evolution of base and aspect codes. XE was implemented by <a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/%7Esbajrach/">Sushil Bajracharya</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/%7Ewruengme/">Wiwat
Ruengmee</a> under supervision of prof. Crista Lopes. <br />

We are currently performing user

<td>The concept of continuous coordination unifies the
formerly opposed
strategies of formal and informal coordination into a single concept.
Continuous coordination recognizes and supports the understanding that
both aspects are legitimate and equally important and necessary
requirements for collaboration activities. It relies on formal
coordination mechanisms to ensure the consistency of the artifact, but
uses informal techniques to allow users to determine the best ways for
the consistency to be achieved – all in a modeless manner. <br />
<br />
From a software engineering perspective, the impact
of formal coordination points (e.g. check-ins or process transitions)
can thereby be much more easily assessed while an activity is in
progress, allowing pre-emptive user actions to ease the burden of
coordination that otherwise would arise at the formal coordination
points. <br />

as a feature of
their technologies, on the assumption that transparent approaches can
more easily be integrated with existing practices.
However,&nbsp;that transparent security mechanisms based on the
"security through obscurity" principle,&nbsp; make it impossible
for users to assess the security implications
of their own actions. The complexity of using,
monitoring and comprehending security technologies and their
relationship to applications and tasks is a critical problem for
improving effective security. Before computing can be trusted, it must
be trustable. A trustable infrastructure is one that makes its actions
observable and verifiable.<br />
<br />
In this project, we validated the hypothesis that by providing users
with a technical infrastructure which makes visible the configuration,
activity, and implications of available security mechanisms, users can
make informed choices about their behavior; yielding more effective,
more secure system use. <br />
<br />
To test this hypothesis, we built impromptu, a "trustable"
infrastructure that makes information and security policy and
configuration available to end users in ways that are visible, usable,
and integrated with their normal activities. The hypothesis was
validated through different user studies.

Contextual
collaboration seamlessly integrates existing Groupware technologies
into a uniform user experience that combines synchronous and
asynchronous interactions. This user experience is usually supported by
a collaboration infrastructure that needs to efficiently cope with the
fast switching and integration of different modes of interaction. <br />
<br />
In
this work, I studied a model for contextual collaboration that supports
multiple modalities of collaboration. The model is based on generic
shared objects that provide building blocks for supporting contextual
collaboration applications. I compared a native implementation with
an alternative
implementation that integrates existing notification and meeting
servers to deliver the same model behavior. Contrary to a common
belief,&nbsp; the reuse of specialized infrastructures did not
perform
as well as the native implementation, in particular, for highly
interactive applications. <br />
